# Tech Spec
The _Tech Spec_ is an important part of a project, but it's a part that's often overlooked or skipped. The intention of this document is to organize everyone's thoughts on the project into one simple, succinct document.

## Overview
Flo's Whistle is a secure, anonymous platform where direct patient care providers in the U.S. can report, once a day, on workplace deficits that are endangering them and their patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing many lethal faults in our healthcare system. Direct care providers can see, from within the system, where dangers lie. As witnesses on the front lines, if we can report our frist hand knowledge, we can contribute to a fuller understanding of the pandemic situation as it unfolds.

## Scenarios
This section (and subsections) should describe a couple of real-world scenarios that demonstrate the need for the project. This should include an example of the problem, and an example of how the project will resolve that problem. It is recommended that at least 2 scenarios are provided.

## Non Goals
This project will not:
- Allow user logins
- Verify data sources

## Minimum Viable Product
This product will:
- Allow users to anonymously file reports
- Display aggregate data graphically

## Diorama-rama
Can you put your project into pictures? Sure you can! We recommend using [draw.io](https://draw.io) because it's free and you can make pretty diagrams of all sorts like this:

## Components
Break down your project into as many different sections or components as possible. This could include various pages for a web app, or endpoints for an API project just to name a couple of examples. Try to include any wireframes or mock-ups you can to fully illustrate your idea for each piece!

## Roadmap
Give some timelines. These don't have to be fully detailed, but it's good to set goals and make them visible. Any dates here should match _Milestones_ set in the github project.

## Contact Info
Give as much, or as little, info as you want here.
