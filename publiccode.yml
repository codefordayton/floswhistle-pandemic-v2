    shortDescription: >
          A safe space for patient care providers to provide 
          information regarding care.

    longDescription: >
          Flo's Whistle is a secure, anonymous platform where 
          direct patient care providers in the U.S. can report, 
          once a day, on workplace deficits that are endangering 
          them and their patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is 
          exposing many lethal faults in our healthcare system. 
          Direct care providers can see, from within the system, 
          where dangers lie. As witnesses on the front lines, 
          if we can report our frist hand knowledge, we can 
          contribute to a fuller understanding of the pandemic 
          situation as it unfolds.
