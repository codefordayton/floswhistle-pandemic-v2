## What is this? 
Flo's Whistle is a secure, anonymous platform where direct patient care providers in the U.S. can report, once a day, on workplace deficits that are endangering them and their patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing many lethal faults in our healthcare system. Direct care providers can see, from within the system, where dangers lie. As witnesses on the front lines, if we can report our frist hand knowledge, we can contribute to a fuller understanding of the pandemic situation as it unfolds.

## Documentation
We've included a `docs` folder with a template [Tech Spec](/docs/Tech_Spec.md) and [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) document.
