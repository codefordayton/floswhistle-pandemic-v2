## What is this?
Flo's Whistle is a secure, anonymous platform where direct patient care providers in the U.S. can report, once a day, on workplace deficits that are endangering them and their patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing many lethal faults in our healthcare system. Direct care providers can see, from within the system, where dangers lie. As witnesses on the front lines, if we can report our frist hand knowledge, we can contribute to a fuller understanding of the pandemic situation as it unfolds.

## Documentation
We've included a `docs` folder with a template [Tech Spec](/docs/Tech_Spec.md) and [Best Practices](/docs/Best_Practices.md) document.

# Setup
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
